## Overview

HelioEye is an innovative solar tracking and energy monitoring system designed to maximize energy generation from photovoltaic panels. This project aims to address the limitations of stationary solar panels by implementing a dual-axis rotation system, allowing panels to dynamically face the sun for optimal energy production. The system provides real-time energy generation data, periodic predictions, and a user-friendly interface for monitoring and analysis.

## Features

### 1. Solar Panel Rotation

- Dual-axis rotation system to dynamically position solar panels towards the sun.
- Continuous tracking for maximum energy coverage throughout the day.

### 2. Energy Generation Monitoring

- Real-time monitoring of energy generation levels.
- Past energy generation data showcasing.
- Graphical data showcasing for better visualization.

### 3. Real-time Data Presentation

- Web application for instant access to live energy generation statistics.
- User-friendly interface for easy interpretation of data.

## Problem

- No Solutions in Sri Lanka for an automated sun-tracking system
- Lack of system for energy data showcasing applications

## Solution

HelioEye addresses these issues by implementing a dual-axis rotation system for solar panels, and a web application that provides real-time and past energy generation data. 

## Getting Started

To start using HelioEye, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Buy and Install the solar tracking module on your solar panels from our partners. Provide a valid email to the vendor when you are purchasing the device.
2. **Register**: Access the web app and register using the email you provided to the vendor.
3. **Add Device**: Add your solar tracking device to your account by entering the unique ID given to you with your purchase.

Now your app is ready to use.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with smart home systems for automated energy management.
- Expansion of predictive analytics for more accurate long-term forecasts.
